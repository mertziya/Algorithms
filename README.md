# Algorithms

# Overview
Welcome to my GitHub repository containing coursework from the Algorithms course (CS 301) at Sabanci University. This repository features a range of homework assignments and a final project, demonstrating my understanding and application of various algorithmic concepts.

# Homework Assignments
##Homework 1:
    Questions on algorithm complexity, worst-case and best-case behaviors of
    insertion sort, and the ranking of functions based on their growth rates​​.
    
    
##Homework 2:

__Question 1:__ Algorithm design for selecting students for a scientific visit based on their grades in CS301​​.
__Question 2:__ Optimization and decision problem formulation for messaging friends on a special day without repeating messages to friends who know each other​​.
__Question 3:__ Analysis of red-black tree insertions, including rotations and node recoloring​​.
__Question 4:__ Understanding NP problems, with definitions and examples​​.


##Homework 3:

__Question 1:__ The Longest Palindromic Subsequence (LPS) problem using dynamic programming​​.

__Question 2:__ The 0-1 Knapsack problem - both dynamic programming and greedy solutions​​.

__Question 3:__ Greedy solution for a variation of the 0-1 Knapsack problem​​.

##Homework 4:

__Question 1:__ Designing flow networks with non-unique max-flow functions​​.

__Question 2:__ Proving the uniqueness of max-flow functions in certain flow networks​​.

__Question 3:__ Analysis of summing flow functions in networks​​.


#Final Project: Graph Partitioning

##Problem Description:
    The project tackles the Graph Partitioning problem, an NP-complete problem, with applications in various fields like parallel computing and social network analysis​​.
    
##Algorithms Implemented:
__Brute Force Algorithm:__ A complete but inefficient solution with a complexity of O(2^(2n))​​.

__Heuristic Algorithm:__ A greedy heuristic providing a more efficient, though not always optimal, solution​​.

##Algorithm Analysis:
__Brute Force Algorithm:__ Correctness proof and complexity analysis​​.

__Heuristic Algorithm:__ Explanation of the heuristic's approach and its efficiency, including a polynomial-time complexity​​.

##Technologies Used:
_Programming Language:_ C++
_Tools and Libraries:_ Standard programming libraries and tools for algorithm implementation and analysis.
