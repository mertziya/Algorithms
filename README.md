# Algorithms

## Overview
Welcome to my GitHub repository containing coursework from the Algorithms course (CS 301) at Sabanci University. This repository features a range of homework assignments and a final project, demonstrating my understanding and application of various algorithmic concepts.

## Homework Assignments
### Homework 1
- **Topics Covered:** Questions on algorithm complexity, worst-case and best-case behaviors of insertion sort, and the ranking of functions based on their growth rates.

### Homework 2
- **Question 1:** Algorithm design for selecting students for a scientific visit based on their grades in CS301.
- **Question 2:** Optimization and decision problem formulation for messaging friends on a special day without repeating messages to friends who know each other.
- **Question 3:** Analysis of red-black tree insertions, including rotations and node recoloring.
- **Question 4:** Understanding NP problems, with definitions and examples.

### Homework 3
- **Question 1:** The Longest Palindromic Subsequence (LPS) problem using dynamic programming.
- **Question 2:** The 0-1 Knapsack problem - both dynamic programming and greedy solutions.
- **Question 3:** Greedy solution for a variation of the 0-1 Knapsack problem.

### Homework 4
- **Question 1:** Designing flow networks with non-unique max-flow functions.
- **Question 2:** Proving the uniqueness of max-flow functions in certain flow networks.
- **Question 3:** Analysis of summing flow functions in networks.

## Final Project: Graph Partitioning
### Problem Description
The project tackles the Graph Partitioning problem, an NP-complete problem, with applications in various fields like parallel computing and social network analysis.

### Algorithms Implemented
- **Brute Force Algorithm:** A complete but inefficient solution with a complexity of O(2^(2n)).
- **Heuristic Algorithm:** A greedy heuristic providing a more efficient, though not always optimal, solution.

### Algorithm Analysis
- **Brute Force Algorithm:** Correctness proof and complexity analysis.
- **Heuristic Algorithm:** Explanation of the heuristic's approach and its efficiency, including a polynomial-time complexity.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** C++
- **Tools and Libraries:** Standard programming libraries and tools for algorithm implementation and analysis.
